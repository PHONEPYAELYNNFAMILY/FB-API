Copy and paste the following code between &lt;head> and &lt;/head> on the page of your website you want to track actions. For example, to track registrations, place the code on your 'registration completed' web page. To verify that the pixel is working correctly, test it by navigating to the web page you put the pixel on. If it's working, the pixel will send that information back to Facebook. Come back to Facebook to start using your website conversion-tracking pixel in your campaigns. &lt;!-- Facebook Conversion Code for Example -->
